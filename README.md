# Welcome to Zorp – The Language Guide

Zorp is a language I made all the way back in 2008 while I was sick and bored more then your average ipad kid without it's iPad. I just recently found this file in an old USB drive while sorting out some old shit
that was in a box labeled: "For future me - Things I did when I was young" The language got so big that I abandoned it, but now X amount of years later, I am now back to plaugue myself with this again.

Zorp is a unique, expressive language designed for secret messages, playful communication, and creative writing. This guide explains **how to read, pronounce, and use Zorp** to its full potential.

**NOTE:** Read this file first, then open the "Compartments" folder and read the file: "COMPARTMENTSGUIDE.md" as it will guide you on how to find all words.

## 1. Pronunciation Basics

- Every letter is pronounced as written, except **'e'**, which does not exist in Zorp.  
- **High and Low letters:**  
  - 'm' is high/lighter → often makes words sound positive.  
  - 'd' is low/darker → often makes words sound negative.  
- **Syllable stress:** The first syllable of every word is slightly stressed.  
- **Blending:** Short phrases, greetings, and sequential verbs are often spoken as one word, even if written separately.

## 2. Punctuation Rules (ZPRs)

- **ZPR #3:** Only periods (.) create a pause in speech. All other punctuation (commas, !, ?, :, ;) are ignored while speaking but still used when writing.  
- **Interjections (ZPR #5):** Greetings like **Yom** can blend with following verbs naturally.  
- **Verb Blending (ZPR #4):** Sequential verbs are pronounced as one word.  

---

## 3. Greetings

- **Yom** → any positive greeting  
- **Nomd** → any negative/insulting greeting  

---

## 4. Possession / Ownership (ZPR #13)

- To show ownership, the **owner** must be specified:  
  - Example: `Iskr mi zorn` → “It’s my secret”  
  - Example: `Iskr sa zorn` → “It’s his/her secret”  
  - You can also add a name: `Iskr John sa zorn` → “It’s John’s secret”

## 5. Special Conversion Rules

- **ZPR #2:** Letter 'e' does not exist.  
- **ZPR #12:** When converting English → Zorp, **'a'** is skipped. When converting back, add 'a' where needed.  
- **Function words / contractions:** Use Zorp equivalents for words like: it’s, it, that, really, won’t, don’t, can, cannot, and, or, but, if, because, with, without, etc.

## 6. Building Sentences

- Word order is flexible but often follows **subject → verb → object → emotion/state → additional info**.  
- Short phrases and greetings are often blended.  
- Example:  
  - English: “Hi! I jump so happy.”  
  - Zorp: `Yom! Mi plim su lum.`  
- Example with ownership:  
  - English: “It’s my secret.”  
  - Zorp: `Iskr mi zorn.`

## 7. Tips for Mastery

1. **Always specify the owner** for secrets, feelings, or possessions.  
2. **Blend short phrases and verbs naturally** while speaking.  
3. **Avoid using 'e'**; substitute or drop it.  
4. **Use Zorp vocabulary consistently** for clarity.  
5. **Feel free to add symbols or numbers** for secret communication (optional).

The Zorp vocabulary is organized into compartments to make it easier to learn and navigate:

## 10. Notes

- Zorp is designed to be **playful, secretive, and flexible**.  
- Use it to write messages that **only people who know the rules can understand**.  
- You can continue to expand the language with new words, verbs, and expressions!  
- Make sure NOT to use Zorp to talk about anyone negativeley, as Zorp was only meant to discuss secrets and pull jokes you wouldn't normally say, not anything else.

## 11. How to Expand

- If you ever want to add a new word, feel free to do it. But it has to be reasonable, so not something like:"Bitch", or: "Whore" *(NOTE: That was purely said as an example and not towards anybody. It was not meant to hurt anybody)* and if you want to add new words for every one, then just drop it into the comment section and I'll look over it. *(NOTE: The Zorp word has to be free and not overruling annother word)*
- Make sure to put it inside the correct Compartment though, as other wise it will be confusing.
