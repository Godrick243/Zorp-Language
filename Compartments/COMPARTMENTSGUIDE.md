# Compartment Guide to Zorp

This is the official guide to how to find things in the "Compartments" folder. (I sounded like Micrsoft there didn't I?)

## 1. How to Find Your Word

- Go to the folder where you think the word you're looking for most likely is. If it's not there, continue looking in similar folders.

## 2. How to Find Your Word if You Don't Know

- If you don't know what type of word it is, explore folders where it probably belongs. If you still can't find it, contact me (godrick.yt.3@gmail.com).

## 3. If You Still Can't Find Your Word

- If this is the case, it's highly likely that your word doesn't exist yet. If so, give an AI (like ChatGPT) the full "Compartment" folder and ask it to find or suggest the word you want.  
  *(NOTE: You may need to compress the folder into a .zip file for that)*
