# This is the changelog for the Zorp Language

## Version 1.0.1 (Current) [2025-08-31] *(I got exited ok guys?)*
- Added the .txt file with dialogue examples

## Version 1.0.0 [2025-08-31]
- Added the base rules and words.
- Setup the compartments and all of the current files.

## Plans for future updates
- I plan on adding a .py script that can convert from Zorp to English and vice-versa.
- I also plan on adding more Compartments, as right now it's a little too small to be called a "Language".
