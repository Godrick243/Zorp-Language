# This is the changelog for the Zorp Language

## Version 1.0.0 (Current) [2025-31/08]
- Added base rules and words

## Plans for futeure updates
- I plan on adding a .py script that can convert from Zorp to English and vice-versa.
- I also plan on adding more Compartments, as right now I think there are a little to few words and so.
